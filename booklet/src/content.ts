/**
 * Cadence System Card — copy + verified data (self-contained).
 *
 * Every number here is verified against the taskflow-calendar-main repo
 * (branch main) and carries a `source · file:line` rail where it is a
 * measured/enforced fact. Nothing is invented. A few deliberate honesty calls,
 * grounded in the code rather than a marketing line:
 *
 *   · "32 serverless handlers" is the figure the app itself reports
 *     (Welcome.tsx:276) and the dispatcher's own docstring records
 *     (api/index.ts:6). A literal count of the current tree is 34 handler
 *     files / 34 routes — the two extra are `health` + `test` diagnostics;
 *     34 − 2 = 32 product handlers. We print 32 and note the count.
 *   · "1,145 tests" is the app-reported green figure (Welcome.tsx:219, 278).
 *     A static count of `it()/test()` calls across the tree is ~1,249
 *     (634 frontend + 615 backend/handler). We print the reported figure and
 *     note the static count, the same way the app states it.
 *   · Google Calendar sync is genuinely ONE-WAY: a read-only pull. The handler
 *     requests only the `calendar.readonly` scope (google/calendar.ts:25).
 *
 * The parse showcase examples are the app's OWN landing examples, verbatim
 * (Welcome.tsx:34–66) — real smart-input behavior, not a benchmark.
